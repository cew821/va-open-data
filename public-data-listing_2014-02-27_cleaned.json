Commercial buildings include all buildings in which at least half of the floorspace is used for a purpose that is not residential, industrial, or agricultural, so they include building types that might not traditionally be considered \"commercial,\" such as schools, correctional institutions, and buildings used for religious worship.\nThe CBECS was first conducted in 1979; the eighth, and most recent survey, was conducted in 2003. CBECS is currently conducted on a quadrennial basis.",

The outcomes featured have had significant economic impact, have improved people's lives, or have been widely recognized as a remarkable advance in science. An R&D accomplishment is the outcome of past research whose benefits are being realized now. It may describe the results of decades of R&D or a one-time breakthrough by an individual researcher. \nThe core of the site is the DOE R&D Accomplishments Database, consisting of searchable electronic documents, with bibliographic citations, that report accomplishments from the Department of Energy, DOE contractor facilities, and DOE predecessors: the Manhattan Project, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), and the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA). \nComplementing the database are Feature Topic pages, Laureates, Interesting Insights, and Snapshots. Featured Topic pages spotlight an individual scientist or an area of research. Laureate information includes names, date, and type (Nobel or Fermi).  Interesting insights provides a unique view of DOE and predecessor agency research and developments.  Snapshots provide quick pictures, introductions, overviews, or synopses of DOE accomplishments.",

This raw data set contains CX determinations required to be posted under the policy, and also some for which documentation and posting are optional, i.e., determinations involving classes of actions listed in Appendix A or made before the policy's effective date of November 2, 2009.  The data set includes information by state, CX applied, date range, DOE Program, Field, or Site Office, keyword, and whether the CX determination is for a project related to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act or ARRA) of 2009.  The web address to the CX determination documents are provided.  This data set will be updated approximately monthly.  See www.gc.doe.gov/NEPA/categorical_exclusion_determinations.htm for information on DOE CX procedures.

      "title":"SciTech Connect",
      "description":"SciTech Connect is a portal to free, publicly-available DOE-sponsored R&D results including technical reports, bibliographic citations, journal articles, conference papers, books, multimedia and data information. SciTech Connect is a consolidation of two core DOE search engines, the Information Bridge and the Energy Citations Database. SciTech Connect incorporates all of the R&D information from these two products into one search interface. SciTech Connect was developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) to increase access to science, technology, and engineering research information from DOE and its predecessor agencies.\nSciTech Connect contains all the full-text documents and citations previously found in Information Bridge and Energy Citations Database. Thus, SciTech Connect contains over sixty-five years of energy-related citations created and/or collected by OSTI. \n\nSciTech Connect includes technical reports, bibliographic citations, journal articles, conference papers, books, multimedia, and data information sponsored by DOE through a grant, contract, cooperative agreement, or similar type of funding mechanism from the 1940s to today. This collection continues to grow as new scientific and technical information resulting from DOE research becomes available. \n\nThere are over 2.5 million citations, including citations to 1.4 million journal articles, 364,000 of which have digital object identifiers (DOIs) linking to full-text articles on publishers' websites. SciTech Connect also has over 313,000 full-text DOE sponsored STI reports; most of these are post-1991, but close to 85,000 of the reports were published prior to 1990.\nThe SciTech Connect Basic Search utilizes a semantic search technique called keyword-to-concept mapping. Your search term will be mapped to related scientific concepts allowing you to retrieve results related to your search term, but also to explore narrower and similar concepts.",

      "description":"Field Samples are physical media collected during the response which are subsequently analyzed either in a laboratory or in the field using InSitu equipment. Common field samples include air filters and soil samples. Radiochemistry analysis typically reports the presence of specific radionuclides measured as total activity or as either activity/unit of mass or activity/unit of volume, depending upon the sample media. In addition, total beta and total alpha activity may be reported. Currently, air filter and soil sample analysis results may be downloaded through the data repository. Both data sets are similar; they contain a number of columns describing the collected sample as well as the results of radiochemical analysis. In addition, there are a number of special fields that are specific to a given sample type; e.g. Air Filters specify the filter type and total volume, while soil samples specify the sample weight. For convenience, the sample information and subsequent analysis has been \"flattened\" into a simple tabular format. Consequently, if a sample has multiple analysis results the \"sample collection\" values will be repeated through the set; e.g., sample ID#, barcode, latitude/longitude, collection date etc. To be included in the data repository, a given sample must meet the following criteria: has a valid latitude, longitude, and collection date; has been sent to a laboratory for analysis, or had analysis performed in the field; has at least one valid analysis result with a reportable unit, nuclide, and activity which has been validated by an authorized laboratory staff member. These results represent raw data that have been calibrated  to physical units and validated. They do not include any further evaluation.",

      "title":"The Open PV Project",
      "description":"# The Project #\r\n\r\nThe Open PV Project is a collaborative effort between government, industry, and the public that is compiling a comprehensive database of photovoltaic (PV) installation data for the United States. Data for the project are voluntarily contributed from a variety of sources including utilities, installers, and the general public. The data collected is actively maintained by the contributors and are always changing to provide an evolving, up-to-date snapshot of the US solar power market.\r\n\r\n![Image of solar deployments on a map](https://openpv.nrel.gov/assets/img/viz_slideshow/timeMapper_panel.jpg)\r\n\r\n# Data Collection #\r\n\r\nThe Open PV Project is collecting data from any willing contributor of available information. NREL has \"seeded\" the Open PV database by requesting data from most state run incentive programs, large utilities, and other organizations. This initial data collection has provided a solid base of data for the project to launch from and it is our hope that the database will continue to grow through contributions from the PV community and anyone interested in understanding PV market dynamics in the US.\r\n\r\n## Data Quality ##\r\n\r\nDetermining the quality of incoming data is dependent upon who is submitting the data to the project. This means that data coming from users associated with a particular organization may be \"trusted\" more than data from other unknown users. Each registered user is assigned a default \"score\" based on their organizational affiliation. This score is highest for Government users (State, Federal, etc.) because such users are often involved with incentive programs that have a defined data collection process in place. Second are utility and PV installers (and others in the PV industry), and so on. All users who contribute data to the project have the ability to gain a \"project reputation\" that can impact the score of the data they contribute.\r\n\r\n## Validation ##\r\n\r\nData validation occurs on each record in the database on a regular basis. The database is continually analyzed for corrupt records, bad or invalid data, and outliers such as an abnormal cost to watt ratio. Records found to contain questionable data are flagged and are dealt with on a case by case basis by a member of the Open PV Team.\r\n\r\n## Duplication ##\r\n\r\nUnderstanding duplication is one of the ways that individual records are validated. In a publicly contributed database, it is imperative to anticipate the submission of duplicate records. When duplicate records are detected, they are added to an install specific list of duplicates and the data provided are aggregated into \"summary records\" of their respective installs. Identifying duplicate records helps validate PV installs in the database. The more a PV installation is duplicated in the database, the more trust the project places on the data for that installation.\r\n\r\n# Data Fields #\r\n## Required Fields ##\r\n\r\nThe Open PV Project is designed to be able to store nearly any type of information pertaining to PV installations. In order to provide the primary statistics from the database we have identified 4 data fields that are required of each PV install added to the project. These four fields are:\r\n\r\n-  Date Installed (Completion date or interconnection date)\r\n-  Size/Capacity of the PV Installation (in kW DC)\r\n-  Location (Zipcode or Street Address)\r\n-  Total Installed Cost (in USD, before incentives)\r\n\r\n## Additional Fields ##\r\n\r\nThe four required fields listed above provide the Open PV Project with the base information needed to derive several key statistics on the US PV market, including historical trends and regional comparisons. However, the design of the Open PV database is capable of storing nearly any type of data associated with PV installation, so the Open PV Team would like to encourage you to contribute any additional information you are comfortable sharing. This extra information can be extremely valuable, for example, data that contains information about who installed the PV installation can help to answer very useful questions about where certain installers are working. Information on module or inverter types can be useful in mapping efficiency and detailed financing information can be a key factor in understanding trends in overall installation cost. The Open PV Team strongly encourages you to contribute any data you feel comfortable providing, especially data you would like to see visualized in our gallery someday.",

FY 2008 base year inventories were also reported at that time.\r\n\r\n### Federal GHG Requirements Overview ###\r\n\r\nE.O. 13514 required Federal agencies to set individual targets for reduction of combined Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in FY 2020 compared to FY 2008. When all agency targets are combined, the overall target for the entire Federal Government is a 28% reduction in FY 2020 compared to FY 2008. GHG emissions from certain types of activities are not subject to the reduction targets, including emissions from generation of electric power sold to others and from fuels used in excluded vehicles and equipment (such as tactical, combat support, law enforcement, emergency response, and spaceflight operations).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, separate targets were established for indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions with a combined Federal Government target of a 13% reduction in FY 2020 compared to FY 2008.

      "description":"Find alternative fueling stations near an address or ZIP code or along a route in the United States. Enter a state to see a station count.\r\n\r\n## Data Collection Methods ##\r\n\r\nThe data in the Alternative Fueling Station Locator are gathered and verified through a variety of methods. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) obtains information about new stations from trade media, Clean Cities coordinators, an Add a Station form on the Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) website, and through collaborating with infrastructure equipment and fuel providers.\r\n\r\nNREL regularly compares its station data with those of other relevant trade organizations and websites. Differences in methodologies and inclusion criteria may result in slight differences between NREL's database and those maintained by other organizations. NREL also collaborates with alternative fuel industry groups to maintain the data. NREL and its data collection subcontractor are currently collaborating with natural gas, electric drive, biodiesel, ethanol, and propane industry groups to establish best practices for identifying new stations in the most-timely manner possible and to develop a more rigorous network for the future.\r\n\r\n## Station Update Schedule ##\r\n\r\nExisting stations in the database are contacted at least once a year on an established schedule to verify they are still operational and dispensing the fuel specified. Based on an established data collection schedule, the database is updated once a month with the exception of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) data, which are updated twice a month. Stations that are no longer operational or no longer provide alternative fuel are removed from the database on a monthly basis or as they are identified.\r\n\r\n## Mapping and Counting Methods ##\r\n\r\nEach point on the map is counted as one station in the station count. A station appears as one point on the map, regardless of the number of fuel dispensers or charging outlets at that location. Station addresses are geocoded and mapped using an automatic geocoding application. The geocoding application returns the most accurate location based on the provided address. Station locations may also be provided by external sources (e.g., station operators) and/or verified in a geographic information system (GIS) tool like Google Earth, Google Maps, or Google StreetView. This information is considered highly accurate, and these coordinates override any information generated using the geocoding application.\r\n\r\n## Notes about Specific Station Types ##\r\n### Private Stations ###\r\nStations with an Access of \"Private - Fleet customers only\" may allow other entities to fuel through a business-to-business arrangement. For more information, fleet customers should refer to the information listed in the details section for that station to contact the station directly.\r\n\r\n### Biodiesel Stations ###\r\nThe Alternative Fueling Station Locator only includes stations offering biodiesel blends of 20% (B20) and above.\r\n\r\n### Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) ###\r\nAn electric charging station, or EVSE, appears as one point on the map, regardless of the number of charging outlets at that location. The number and type of charging outlets available are displayed as additional details when the station location is selected. Each point on the map is counted as one station in the station count. To see a total count of EVSE for all outlets available, go to the Alternative Fueling Station Counts by State table. Residential EVSE locations are not included in the Alternative Fueling Station Locator.\r\n\r\n## Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Propane) Stations ###\r\nBecause many propane stations serve customers other than drivers and fleets, NREL collaborated with the industry to effectively represent the differences. Each propane station is designated as a 'primary' or 'secondary' service type. Both types are able to fuel vehicles. However, locations with a 'primary' designation offer vehicle services and fuel priced specifically for use in vehicles. The details page for each station lists its service designation.\r\n",

An industrial assessment is, quite simply, an in-depth assessment of a plant site; its facilities, services and manufacturing operations. This term is used to refer to a process which involves a thorough examination of potential savings from:\r\n\r\n  - energy efficiency improvements\r\n  - waste minimization and pollution prevention\r\n  - productivity improvement\r\n\r\nAssessments are performed by local teams of engineering faculty and students from 24 centers and 32 participating universities across the country.\r\n\r\nThe assessment begins with a university-based IAC team conducting a survey of the eligible plant, followed by a one or two day site visit, taking engineering measurements as a basis for assessment recommendations. The team then performs a detailed analysis for specific recommendations with related estimates of costs, performance and payback times.\r\n\r\nWithin 60 days, a confidential report, detailing the analysis, findings and recommendations of the team is sent to the plant. In two to six months, follow-up phone calls are placed to the plant manager to verify recommendations that will be implemented.",

      "description":"A multi-modal study of the demographic and travel behavior characteristics of residents across the entire State of California, the 2010-2012 California Household Travel Survey (CHTS) was the largest single regional household travel survey ever conducted in the United States. Detailed travel behavior information was obtained from more than 42,500 households via multiple data-collection methods, including computer-assisted telephone interviewing, online and mail surveys, wearable and in-vehicle GPS, and on-board diagnostic (OBD) sensors that gathered data directly from a vehicle's engine. Details of personal travel behavior were gathered within the region of residence, inter-regionally within the state, and in adjoining states and Mexico. The survey sampling plan was designed to ensure an accurate representation of the entire population of the state.\r\n\r\nThe CHTS included additional features—more detailed data on vehicle-acquisition decisions, parking choices, work schedules and flexibility, use of toll lanes/priced facilities, and walk and bicycle trips—to support advanced model development.\r\n\r\n## GPS Data Logger/On-Board Diagnostic Sensor ##\r\n\r\nThe GPS device used in the vehicle-based portion of the study and to support OBD data collection was the QStarz BT-Q1000x travel recorder, which recorded data at 1-second intervals. Additionally, a CarChip Fleet Pro OBD sensor was used in coordination with the in-vehicle GPS to collect vehicle speed, air-flow rate, throttle position, engine load, and engine speed in 5-second intervals. For the wearable portion of the study, the GlobalSat GPS data logger was used. This device was programmed to collect data at 3-second intervals and to record all GPS points where the speed was greater than one mph.",

Novice users and seasoned practitioners can use the freely available and uniquely identifiable components to create energy models and cite the sources of input data, which will increase the credibility and reproducibility of their simulations.\r\n\r\nThe BCL contains components which are the building blocks of an energy model. They can represent physical characteristics of the building such as roofs, walls, and windows, or can refer to related operational information such as occupancy and equipment schedules and weather information. Each component is identified through a set of attributes that are specific to its type, as well as other metadata such as provenance information and associated files.\r\n\r\nThe BCL also contains energy conservation measures (ECM), referred to as measures, which describe a change to a building and its associated model. For the BCL, this description attempts to define a measure for reproducible application, either to compare it to a baseline model, to estimate potential energy savings, or to examine the effects of a particular implementation.\r\n\r\nThe BCL currently contains more than 30,000 components and measures. A faceted search mechanism has been implemented on the BCL that allows users to filter through the search results using various facets. Facet categories include component and measure types, data source, and energy modeling software type. All attributes of a component or measure can also be used to filter the results.",

      "description":"CREST is an economic cash flow model designed to allow policymakers, regulators, and the renewable energy community to assess project economics, design cost-based incentives (e.g., feed-in tariffs), and evaluate the impact of various state and federal support structures. CREST is a suite of four analytic tools, for solar (photovoltaic and solar thermal), wind, geothermal, and anaerobic digestion technologies. It is also used by project managers to do preliminary back-of-the-envelope calculations of the year one cost of energy for renewable energy projects.",

      "description":"# About the Energy Innovation Portal #\r\n\r\nThe Energy Innovation Portal is a one-stop resource for Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) technologies. This application enables users to locate technologies developed with DOE funding and available for licensing. These technologies can be viewed as marketing summaries, which provide business friendly descriptions of the technology, or the patent itself. When you find a technology you are interested in, simply fill out the contact form to get directly in touch with the licensing representative from each laboratory.\r\n\r\n## Creation of the Energy Innovation Portal ##\r\n\r\nIn its proposal to manage the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the Alliance for Sustainable Energy LLC came up with the concept for an Intellectual Portal (IP Portal). The IP Portal was to be a single source for national laboratories, and other stakeholders (such as university partners) to post high quality marketing summaries with the hope of increasing licensing deal flow. Many times, potential licensees of laboratory technology had mentioned the difficulty that they experienced while searching for licensing opportunities. The Energy Innovation Portal (the new name of the IP Portal) was designed to help alleviate this concern, and to simultaneously improve the opportunities for cross-lab intellectual property (IP) bundling.\r\n\r\nNREL, initially in collaboration with Battelle Memorial Institute, created the technical architecture and executed the software development for the Energy Innovation Portal, including the selection and integration of more than 50 software applications. The Java-based website employs a MySQL relational database management system and includes a search engine tuned to meet the needs of venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. NREL oversaw the initial development, and executed the subsequent improvements, of a customized software script to automatically populate the MySQL database with more than 16,000 DOE-created patents and patent applications. The data was sourced from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Patents from DOE national laboratories are filed under the names of their managing organizations\u2014 for NREL, it was previously the Midwest Research Institute and is now the Alliance for Sustainable Energy\u2014 but an improved algorithm associated laboratory contract number and management organizations to the laboratories themselves, allowing users to find the relevant patents by simply searching for \"NREL\" or the names of the other national labs.\r\n\r\n## Licensing DOE Technologies ##\r\n\r\nAs research performed within the DOE National Laboratories develops into promising discoveries, patents are pursued to protect the intellectual property. For-profit entities can leverage DOE investments in early-stage and applied research by licensing these intellectual properties to develop the technology toward commercial application.\r\n\r\nThe licensing process is slightly different across national laboratories, so contact the licensing representative listed at the bottom of each marketing summary to discuss your options and start the process.",

      "title":"National Residential Efficiency Measures Database",
      "description":"The National Residential Efficiency Measures Database is a publicly available, centralized resource of residential building retrofit measures and costs for the U.S. building industry.\r\n\r\nWith support from the U.S. Department of Energy, NREL developed this tool to help users determine the most cost-effective retrofit measures for improving energy efficiency of existing homes.\r\n\r\n## About the Database ##\r\n\r\nHere you will find more information about the purpose, audience, and uses for the National Residential Efficiency Measures Database.\r\nPurpose\r\n\r\nNREL developed this database on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy. The purpose of this project is to provide a national unified database of residential building retrofit measures and associated costs. These data are accessible to software programs that evaluate most cost-effective retrofit measures to improve the energy efficiency of residential buildings.\r\n\r\nThis publicly accessible, centralized database of retrofit measures offers the following benefits:\r\n\r\n  - Provides information in a standardized format\r\n  - Improves the technical consistency and accuracy of the results of software programs\r\n  - Enables experts and stakeholders to view the retrofit information and provide comments to improve data quality\r\n  - Supports building science R&D\r\n  - Enhances transparency.\r\n\r\n## Audience ##\r\n\r\nSoftware developers who require residential retrofit performance and cost data for applications that evaluate residential efficiency measures are the primary audience for this database. In addition, home performance contractors and manufacturers of residential materials and equipment may find this information useful.\r\n\r\n## Data Overview ##\r\n\r\nFollowing is an overview of the database structure and content. To learn more about the content, such as how measures were generated and how costs were derived, read the Development DocumentPDF.\r\n\r\n### Measure Types ###\r\n\r\nThe database offers the following types of retrofit measures:\r\n  - Appliances\r\n  - Domestic Hot Water\r\n  - Enclosure\r\n  - Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)\r\n  - Lighting\r\n  - Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n### Measures ###\r\nA measure consists of a typical 'before-component' and 'after-component' state for a certain type of retrofit activity. Each measure will have components, costs, and possibly references associated with it.\r\n\r\n### Components ###\r\nA component provides the physical description of a particular building or system element including, but not limited to, any properties that affect the energy use of the home. A measure has a minimum of two components, before and after, but could have more than two.\r\n\r\n### Properties ###\r\nEach component has a variety of properties to describe it in detail. The properties can include things about the component like lifetime, physical description, performance data, etc.\r\n\r\n### Cost Data ###\r\nThis database provides full cost estimates for many different retrofit measures. For each measure, the database provides a range of costs, as the cost data for a measure can vary widely across regions, houses, and contractors. Climate, construction, home features, local economy, and geographic location all affect the actual cost to perform any of these measures.\r\n\r\nSome measures have multiple costs that must be added together to obtain total cost for the measure. For example, air conditioner measures have a fixed cost ($) and a normalized cost ($/kBtuh) that must be combined to get the total cost for the measure.\r\n\r\nThe cost data represents the total cost to implement the retrofit measure. For example, a new air conditioning unit that just meets code may cost $5,000. In addition to a measure that just meets code, the database may also include a measure to install a more energy-efficient air conditioner that costs $5,700. In this case, the cost listed in the database represents the full cost of the air conditioner ($5,700), and not the incremental cost ($700) to improve the unit from code.\r\n\r\nThis database is not intended to provide specific cost estimates for a specific project. The cost estimates do not include any rebates or tax incentives that may be available for the measures. Rather, it is meant to help determine which measures may be more cost-effective. NREL makes every effort to ensure accuracy of the data; however, NREL does not assume any legal liability or responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the information. ",

      "title":"Wind Energy Resource Data",
      "description":"NREL's Geographic Information System (GIS) team offers both a national wind resource assessment of the United States and high-resolution wind data. The national wind resource assessment was created for the U.S. Department of Energy in 1986 by the Pacific Northwest Laboratory and is documented in the Wind Energy Resource Atlas of the United States, October 1986. This national wind resource data provides an estimate of the annual average wind resource for the conterminous United States, with a resolution of 1/3 degree of latitude by 1/4 degree of longitude.\r\n\r\nThe wind resource assessment was based on surface wind data, coastal marine area data, and upper-air data, where applicable. In data-sparse areas, three qualitative indicators of wind speed or power were used when applicable: topographic/meteorological indicators (e.g. gorges, mountain summits, sheltered valleys); wind deformed vegetation; and eolian landforms (e.g. playas, sand dunes). The data was evaluated at a regional level to produce 12 regional wind resource assessments; the regional assessments were then incorporated into the national wind resource assessment.\r\n\r\nThe conterminous United States was divided into grid cells 1/4 degree of latitude by 1/3 degree of longitude. Each grid cell was assigned a wind power class ranging from 1 to 6, with 6 being the windiest. The wind power density limits for each wind power class are shown in Table 1-1. Each grid cell contains sites of varying power class. The assigned wind power class is representative of the range of wind power densities likely to occur at exposed sites within the grid cell. Hilltops, ridge crests, mountain summits, large clearings, and other locations free of local obstruction to the wind will be well exposed to the wind. In contrast, locations in narrow valleys and canyons, downwind of hills or obstructions, or in forested or urban areas are likely to have poor wind exposure.",
